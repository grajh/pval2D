## pval2D
Python tool, allowing you to effortlessly visualize or export gridded values in two dimensions. With this tool it is possible do draw a map or export gridded values either to PNG file with corresponding PNGW (world) file or to shape file with corresponding prj file. This way importing time of gridded datsets to GIS software (e.g. QGIS) is greatly reduced. Besides a user can visualize the data on the fly, independent of the GIS software. Input ASCII file should have lines formatted as LON, LAT, VALUE. Its format can be arbitrary, but the user has to specify a column separator.

Dependencies:
- Basemap
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- [PyShp](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyshp)

The files are going to be uploaded soon!
